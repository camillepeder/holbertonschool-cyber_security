## Learning objectives:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is Linux
- What is a Linux Command
- What is the structure of the Linux operating system
- What is the purpose of the FHS and what are the benefits of using it
- What are the different directories in the Linux file system, and what are their purposes
- How to protect files and directories
- How to monitor and investigate system activity
- How to securely transfer files and data
- How to configure and manage a firewall
- How to identify and terminate malicious processes
### Working with commands:
- How to use the `ps` and `kill` commands to identify and terminate malicious processes
- How to use the `netstat` and `ss` commands to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity
- How to use the `nmap`, `lynis` and `tcpdump` commands to analyze network traffic for suspicious behavior
- How to use `iptables` and `ufw` to manage the firewall rules on Linux systems
